						Above you'll see the heritage of Bitcoin, the most recognizable cryptocurrency -
						a global concept changing the way we view traditional currencies. Crypto can seem cryptic and out of
						reach for the average person, but it doesn't need to be. What are cryptocurrcencies like Bitcoin?
						How do they work? Most importantly, how might they affect us in the future?

					<h2>A Definition</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						Cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange
						that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units,
						and verify the transaction of assets. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative digital currency.
						Crypto also uses decentralized control to handle all transactions instead of the modern day
						system of handling digital currency by verifying them through central banking systems like Visa and MasterCard.

					<h2>The "Magic" of Blockchain</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						Although cryptocurrency has been thrown around as a buzzword in the last couple of years, many people still have
						little to no idea of how the currency works behind the scenes. Why do people trust it as a source of currency?
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">The Blockchain</p>
							<p>
								At a basic level all cryptocurrencies function through a distributed ledger, or “blockchain,” that serves as an
								entirely public transaction database. In layman’s terms, a blockchain is a chain of transactions,
								many of which form a group of transactions known as blocks.
							</p>
							<p class="gray text-header">And Its Power</p>
							<p>
								What makes blockchain technology powerful is that it can exist securely without a central authority to maintain
								and verify the transactions. Imagine there are millions of copies of the public ledger for bitcoin on computers globally.
								The security of a transaction is based upon the premise that transactions can be verified by checking the ledgers of the
								copied chains across these computers. All proposed additions to the chain must ultimately be accepted by the greater community.
								If not, an addition will be quickly overwritten by the accepted "state" of the ledger. Thus all actors on the blockchain keep
								one another accountable, in a decentralized and anonymous fashion. The “magic” of blockchain is just that.
								Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of blockchain, created a method to solve the issue of verifying a transaction without
								the need of a trusted authority or central server.

					<h2>Who is Playing the Game?</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						While the technology behind cryptocurrency may be complex, 3 main groups are involved
						in the market: exchanges, miners, and traders. In many ways, cryptocurrency shares both similarities and
						differences to the traditional financial market. At the end of the day, some individuals care about the growth
						of crypto as a whole in its stability, adoption and technology, while others just want to make a profit.
						Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the amount of exchanges, mining pools, and average investors catering
						to cryptocurrencies have grown immensely, each looking to take a slice of the pie.
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">Miners and Mining Pools</p>
							<p>
								One of the most common questions asked regarding cryptocurrency is why is it so valuable? There is no
								inherent value in a cryptocurrency, although the same argument could be made of fiat currency. While fiat
								currency is backed by national governments, cryptocurrency is only truly as valuable as the general community
								believes it to be.
							</p>
							<p>
								One may then ask how value is made out of nothing - how are coins created? Governments print their currency.
								For cryptocurrency, individuals "mine" for coins, which they receive through advancing a currency's ledger.
								These individuals are called miners. Mining is essential to cryptocurrencies - it is how the circulation of
								a cryptocurrency increases. A miner for a currency "mines" the blocks that form the blockchain for any
								particular currency. The process of mining is technical, but at its core it is a computational problem,
								one that can only be solved by computers. Once an individual successfully finds a block (a group
								of transactions of the currency that fulfills the requirements to be added to the public ledger), the miner
								is rewarded with a certain number of coins of that currency.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, today it is no longer possible for any single individual with their computer to feasibly solve
								the computational problem required for any valued currency. Thus was the birth of mining pools:
								communities of miners which share and aggregate computing power, distributing the reward for continuing the chain
								amongst members proportionally by their computation contributions.
							</p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">The Casual Investor</p>
							<p>
								Naturally, with an increase in circulation, miners desire a way to be make a profit - selling coins.
								This gave rise to the cryptocurrency market we have today. Thus comes into the picture the average investor.
								These investors engage in the cryptocurrency market by purchasing currencies, thereby also validating
								their worth. In the past, the process of getting started with crypto was difficult.
								Investors would have needed to have a secure wallet on their computer such as an encrypted USB, or have it stored on
								the early, and not very secure, exchanges around 2012. It was a niche market and that showed
								in the valuation of each coin, with Bitcoin being worth about $12 USD in 2012.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, with the advent of exchanges such as Coinbase in late 2012, the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies online
								increased the activity of the casual investors who didn’t want to worry about the technical
								aspects of the market. Since 2012, Coinbase has grown to harbor over 15 million active users,
								and the value of currencies themselves have also grown exponentially along with the increase of
								users throughout the last decade.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">Exchanges</p>
							<p>
								Like the NYSE, there are well-reputed (and some less-so) exchanges through which one can purchase and sell currencies.
								Some of the largest exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and GDax have upwards of billions of US dollars in trade
								volume each day. Although pivotal in the growth of cryptocurrency in the public's eye, they do have drawbacks.
								Today, these exchanges might be ironic given the inherent decentralization of crypto - they control and manage cryptocurrency
								assets for millions of individuals.

							<p class="text-center">
								Cryptocurrency was for the latter half of 2017 considered a goldmine and a bubble - in many ways it was both.
								The hype around cryptocurrency rose enormously, and it became the dominant spectacle and clickbait headliner.
								The path to this growth was long and arduous, and its path since is on shaky ground. Yet, it is important
								to understand the history of cryptocurrency on its rise and fall in the public spotlight.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">(1) The Hobby Era</p>
							<p>
								There have been distinct eras within cryptocurrencies 10 year history. The early hobby
								era began at the launch of Bitcoin in 2009 and ended at the foundation of two dominant trading platforms:
								Mt. Gox and the Silk Road marketplace. This period of growth crashed horribly when both exchanges collapsed.
								Bitcoin dropped from $1000 to just under $300 in a matter of months in 2015.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">(2) The Era of Expansion</p>
							<p>
								From 2014 to 2016 there was a massive diversification of cryptocurrencies from primarily Bitcoin to
								other currencies such as Ethereum and Ripple, amongst dozens of other prominent coins.
								Blockchain technology began being used many disparate platforms, using crypto as
								a vehicle for providing decentralized services. This time period lead to the growth
								of blockchain technology and interest in its technological implications.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">(3) The Gold-Rush Era</p>
							<p>
								In 2017, crypto then shot to the moon with consumers all joining on the Bitcoin train in the hopes of getting rich
								quick. Bitcoin topped just short of $20000, and crypto suddenly became a $750 billion dollar market.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">(4) The Era of Decline and Cynicism</p>
							<p>
								As quickly as it rose, crypto died down, the market corrected and Bitcoin dropped to $4500 per coin (and counting). Commissions
								like the SEC started to become more involved and crypto has started to be viewed and regulated in a traditional
								manner as would warrant any large financial market

						<h1>Central Governments in a Decentralized World</h1>
						<p>
							As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the world's nations are divided on how to regulate the resource
							as most digital currencies are not backed by any government. Most countries lean towards one side or the other regarding
							the legality of crypto. Globally, each country decides whether coins like Bitcoin are legal tender, but have no regulations
							regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. Here's how the world is divided up.
						</p>
						<p>
							Explore the globe to see where bitcoin is legal, get a sense of the government's position on cryptocurrency, and its impact
							in the global market.  Cryptocurrency data is hard to come by due to its anonymous nature.  Volume percentages are calculated
							based on data from fiat-crypto exchanges and government positions and regulations are subject to change at any time.

						There's a huge variation regarding crypto. Although China has outright banned crypto usage and trading,
						many countries like India, Korea, the US and also the EU have stated that crypto is not legal tender,
						but have legal policies regarding crypto exchanges. On the other hand, countries like Switzerland and Japan
						are welcoming the new age of currency with open arms by accepting the use of and exchange of cryptocurrencies.
					</p>
					<p>
						The countries who are against usage of crypto as legal tender have cited reasons being the difficulty in
						tracking the usage of crypto in regards to criminal activity and the difficulty of being able to tax citizens'
						assets on crypto, while countries like Switzerland have openly stated that crypto is "more of an investment than a currency."
					</p>
					<p>
						Although the world is divided on how to tackle cryptocurrency, it's clear that there are both benefits and drawbacks to embracing this new resource.

								For many advocates of cryptocurrency, there is far more to this new market than money.
								Even more so, they might argue that too much attention has been given to the hype of incredible returns,
								when the power of cryptocurrency is in fact its promising technology. They are steadfast in their
								belief of a future where blockchain technology is ubiquitous; however, there are many flaws with the
								current structure of the crypto market than may be readily apparent. These issues must be resolved

								<p class="gray text-header">Energy</p>
								<p>
									There’s talk that cryptocurrencies will eliminate dependency on bank accounts and money-transferring services. But, all that talk isn’t talking about the huge amount of energy mining takes to maintain a blockchain.
									If we take crypto seriously, we need to have a more sustainable way to mining blocks and reduce energy consumption.
									In fact, studies have show that the energy required to maintain JUST Bitcoin’s blockchain is about the same amount of energy that Ireland consumes. That’s a country’s worth of energy.
									One of the largest energy sinks associated with crypto mining is the energy required to cool the computer components. Most commercial miners utilize large data center like warehouses which cool the entire space like an oversized refrigerator.
									The other most obvious use of energy is related to the power consumed by computations. Most of that energy is produced through burning fossil fuels, so a large part of making crypto more sustainable is to reduce the ecological impact it has in its energy consumption.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="margin-20">
								<p class="gray text-header">Market Manipulation</p>
								<p>
									In a world rife with a multitude of exchanges like Bitfinex, GDax, Coinbase, and Kucoin, all of which are highly unregulated.
									there is rampent manipulation of coin prices in effort to make rich patrons of crypto richer. The so called, "crypto whales,"
									have such deep crypto pockets in a relativly low trader populated market, that individuals can single handedly manipulate an exchange.
								</p>
								<p>
									They do so through two basic methods: price suppresion, and price pumping.
								</p>
								<p>
									In price suppresion, whales submit huge orders at incredibly low prices to force the price of a coin to drop dramatically,
									then once their sell wall has satisfactorily been covered, the whale is free to purchase back more coins than they sold at a lower
									price point. This is done during a period right before a beneficial announcment to a coin in effort to capitalize on potential gains.
								</p>
								<p>
									Price pumping is simply the opposite, whale place buy orders at inflated prices with a portion of their coins before selling all at once once their
									optimal price has been reached.
								</p>
								<p>
									This manipulation of coin prices is ongoing in many exchanges as there aren't enough traders to combat this issue with whale leverage.
									And in effect, it creates market panic and causes many average investors to lose incredible amounts of money to these schemes.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="gray text-header">Criminal Activity</p>
							<p>
								Many people today associate cryptocurrency with crime. But is this fact or ignorance? The media has made
								a big deal of people using crypto to evade taxes, but although there is plenty of evidence pointing to the benefits of crypto
								why is there such a bias into thinking crime is elevated with crypto?<br /><br />
								One large reason could be Bitcoin's association with The Slik Road, an online site catering to individuals seeking drugs, weapons and other illicit
								goods. Their main source of payment was bitcoin, due to it's decentralization and anonymity. However, in 2011, the site was shut down by the Federal government.
								but the reputation lives on.<br /><br />
								Since then many criminal activities associated with ransom have defaulted to Bitcoin as their method of payment due to again, the anonymity. Another issue is hackers
								tapping into the power of people's computers, using free electricity to generate millions in crypto. Ironically, the US government has also argued against the use of
								crypto due to their untracable nature, even though dollar bills are generally used by criminals to launder their dirty cash as a digital footprint could almost always
								be tracked.<br /><br />
								A big proponent to crypto and crime is scams. From fake ICO's to hacks on exchange, the wild west of this new currency brings in many investors
								unfamilar with how the currency works and so they get lured into giving up their coins and falling for schemes and scams, thus creating a cycle of
								association with crypto and danger.
							</p>
							<div id="crimeChart"></div>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							<p class="gray text-header">Transaction Delay</p>
							<p>
								Another glaring issue with adopting cryptocurrency globally is the fact that transactions just aren't as fast as Visa or Mastercard.
								When coins like Bitcoin and USDT take up to an hour to successfully process, it's difficult to support the currency in a fast paced economy we have today.
								And although coins like XRP and XLM do boast near instant transactions, this is untested at the volumes Bitcoin processes, and is far below the volume of transactions
								going through either Visa or Mastercard, so before we think about adopting crypto to pay for our next meals, their need to be a solution to increasing the verification speeds.

					<h1>The Future of Cryptocurrency</h1>
					<p>
						This isn't the end all be all of crypto. There are efforts in all of these issues trying to make crypto a viable option for global trade.
						For example, the issue of huge cooling centers is trying to be tackled by 3M, who are developing less wasteful methods of cooling using immersion
						techniques, rather than the tradition radial cooling of components. This new emphasis on crypto is also placing more efforts to reduce reliance
						on fossil fuels in general. Soluna Technologies is one of the innovators in the sector, trying to be the first blockchain company to integrate solely
						on renewable wind power. And efforts like these are being developed constantly, there just needs to be more time.
					</p>
					<p>
						What about transaction speed? As a global economy we can't wait for transactions to happen when money is literally on the line.
						Currently Visa is leading the globe with a theorethical 24000 transactions filled per second (TPS). Paypal can support 200TPS but Bitcoin can only handle maybe
						1-2TPS, leaving customers waiting hours being a sale being finalized, leaving room for both the customer and the retailer
						worried about their payment solution. However, bitcoin's goal was to prove the concept of the blockchain, they weren't optimized
						for such laborious tasks such as processing thousands of tranaction requests. But coins like Ripple were built with speed in mind.
						The creators of the coin claims that the chain can handle 1500TPS comfortably due to the commpany's roots in banking software and
						improving Bitcoin's original algorithm. For developing a coin with faster transaction speeds than even Paypal, the future looks promising for mainstream use of
						crypto.
					</p>
					<p>
						But even with these strides, crypto is going to need a lot more tweeks and improvements before being accepted by the masses.
						Regulations and crime still need to be worked out, speeds need to be improved, and the talks about sustainablity are real issues for the future.
						But because so much work has been going into bringing crypto to the masses, the future looks promising, and maybe we'll be purchasing goods from anywhere in the World
						with a single currency.

					<h1>The Rise and Fall and Rise? And Fall? Of Cryptocurrency</h1>
					<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
					<p> Cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transaction of assets. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative digital currency. Crypto also uses decentralized control to handle all transactions instead of the modern day system of handling digital currency by verifying them through central banking systems like Visa and MasterCard.</p>
					<h2>The "Magic" of Blockchain</h2>
					<p>But how does it work? Crypto has been thrown around a lot in the past couple of years but many people still have little to no idea of how the currency actually works. 
				    The basic idea is that crypto works through a distributed ledger, or “blockchain,” that serves as an entirely public transaction database.
				    In layman’s terms, a blockchain is basically a buzzword for a record of transactions. Each new transaction is attached to the previous transactions all the way back to the very first block. What makes blockchain special is the fact that there are millions of copies of say the chain for bitcoin on millions of computers. The security of a transaction is based upon the idea that transactions can be verified by checking the ledgers of the copied chains across computers, and differences in a chain would cause a transaction not to go through. So each ledger on each computer is keeping one another accountable, all in a decentralized and anonymous fashion.
				    The “magic” of blockchain is just that. Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of blockchain, created a method to solve the issue of verifying a transaction without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
					</p>
					<h2>Who is Playing the Game?</h2>
					<p>Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the amount of exchanges, mining pools, and average investors catering to cryptocurrencies have grown immensely. Some of the largest exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and GDax have upwards of billions of US dollars in trade volume each day.</p><br>
					<p>Mining is also an essential aspect of cryptocurrencies. A miner for a blockchain finds “blocks,” which are just batches of valid transactions for a currency, and hashes and encodes them into a Merkle tree. Each new block contains the encrypted hash of the previously created block, thus linking the transactions and creating a chain which goes back to the genesis block. 
				    However, the days of easily encoding a minute amount of transactions are long gone, and an individual miner with basic computer hardware would require centuries to successfully encrypt a new block. Thus there was a birth of mining pools which share the computing power of any user who wishes to join, and distributes the reward for continuing the chain amongst members equally based off of their contribution amount.
					</p><br>
					<p>So what about the average investor who is supporting crypto by purchasing and adopting the use of the currency.
				    In the past, the process of getting started with crypto was difficult. Investors would have needed to have a secure wallet on their computer, or have it stored on the early possibly not very secure exchanges around 2012. It was a niche market and that showed in the valuation of each coin, with Bitcoin being worth about 12 USD in 2012.
				    However, with the advent of Coinbase in late 2012, the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies through smartphones started to get the ball rolling for average investors who didn’t want to worry about the technical aspects of the market. Since 2012, Coinbase has grown to harbor over 15 million active users, and the value of currencies themselves have also grown exponentially along with the increase of users throughout the last decade.

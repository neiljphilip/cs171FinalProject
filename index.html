					<h2>What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						Cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a <strong>digital asset</strong> designed to work as a medium of exchange
						<strong>that uses cryptography</strong> to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units,
						and verify the transaction of assets. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative to fiat currency, with
						decentralized control to handle all transactions instead of the modern day central banking systems
						like Visa and MasterCard.

					<h2>The "Magic" of Blockchain</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						Although cryptocurrency has been thrown around as a buzzword in the last couple of years, many
						people still little knowledge on how the currency works behind the scenes. Why do people trust it as a source of currency?
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="purple text-header">The Blockchain</p>
							<p>
								All cryptocurrencies function through a <strong>distributed ledger</strong>, or “blockchain,” that serves as an
								entirely public transaction database. In layman’s terms, a blockchain is a chain of transactions,
								many of which form a group of transactions known as blocks.
							</p>
							<p class="purple text-header">And Its Power</p>
							<p>
								What makes blockchain technology powerful is that it can function securely without a central authority to maintain
								and verify transactions. The security of a transaction is based upon the premise that they can be verified by anyone
								simply by checking the public ledger. Actors on the blockchain keep one another accountable, in a <strong>decentralized and anonymous</strong> fashion.

					<h2>Who is Playing the Game?</h2>
					<p class="text-center">
						While the technology behind cryptocurrency may be complex, 3 main groups are involved
						in the market: <strong>miners, traders, and exchanges</strong>. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the amount of exchanges, mining pools, and average investors catering
						to cryptocurrencies have grown immensely, each looking to take a slice of the pie.
					</p>
					<p class="caption-label caption-label-lg text-center">
						Take a look at the major players below.
					</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="purple text-header">Miners and Mining Pools</p>
							<p>
								One of the most common questions asked regarding cryptocurrency is <strong>why is it so valuable?</strong> There is no
								inherent value in a cryptocurrency, although the same argument could be made of fiat currency. While fiat
								currency is backed by national governments, cryptocurrency is only truly as valuable as the general community
								believes it to be.
							</p>
							<p>
								One may then ask <strong>how is value made out of nothing?</strong> Governments print their currency.
								For crypto, individuals "mine" for coins, which they receive through advancing a currency's ledger.
								Mining is essential to crypto - it is how the circulation of a currency increases.
								The process of mining is technical, but at its core it is a <strong>computational problem</strong> that can only be solved by computers.
								Once an individual successfully finds a block (a group of transactions that fulfills certain requirements)
								for the ledger, the miner is rewarded with a certain number of coins.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today it is no longer possible for any single individual to feasibly solve
								this computational problem. This gave rise to mining pools: communities of
								miners which combine computing power, distributing rewards amongst its members.
							</p>

							</div>
							<p class="text-center"></p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="purple text-header">The Casual Investor</p>
							<p>
								With an increase in circulation, miners desired a way to be make a <strong>profit - selling coins</strong>.
								This gave rise to the cryptocurrency market we have today and the average investor.
								These investors purchase currencies, thereby also validating their worth. In the past,
								getting started with crypto was difficult. Investors needed to have a secure wallet on
								their computer such as an encrypted USB, or one of the early insecure exchanges. It was
								<strong>a niche market</strong> and that showed in the valuation of each coin, with Bitcoin being worth
								about $12 USD in 2012.
							</p>
							<p>
								The advent of <strong>exchanges</strong> such as Coinbase in late 2012 grew the online crypto market and
								increased the activity of the casual investor. Since 2012, Coinbase has grown to harbor
								<strong>over 15 million active users</strong>, and the value of currencies themselves have
								grown exponentially along with the increase of users.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6">
							<p class="purple text-header">Exchanges</p>
							<p>
								Like the NYSE, there are well-reputed (and some less-so) exchanges through which one can purchase and sell currencies.
								Some of the largest exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and GDax have upwards of <strong>billions of US dollars in trade
								volume each day</strong>. Although pivotal in the growth of cryptocurrency in the public's eye, they do have drawbacks.
								Today, these exchanges might be <strong>ironic given the inherent decentralization</strong> of crypto - they control and manage cryptocurrency
								assets for millions of individuals.

								<p>
									Commercial miners utilize large data centers - <strong>oversized refrigerators</strong> -

								</p>
								<br/>
								<p class="purple text-subheader">Price Suppression</p>
								<p>
									Large orders are placed at incredibly low prices to force the price of a coin down
									before a beneficial announcement to a coin in effort to capitalize on potential gains.
									Whales purchase many coins at these low prices and then sell high in a quick turnaround.
								</p>
								<br/>
								<p class="purple text-subheader">Price Pumping</p>

								Today, some criminal activities associated with <strong>ransom</strong> have defaulted to Bitcoin as their method

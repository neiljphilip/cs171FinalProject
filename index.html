					<h1>The Rise and Fall and Rise? And Fall? Of Cryptocurrency</h1>

					<h2>[family tree dashboard]</h2>

					<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>

					<p> Cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transaction of assets. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative digital currency. Crypto also uses decentralized control to handle all transactions instead of the modern day system of handling digital currency by verifying them through central banking systems like Visa and MasterCard.</p>

					<h2>The "Magic" of Blockchain</h2>

					<p>But how does it work? Crypto has been thrown around a lot in the past couple of years but many people still have little to no idea of how the currency actually works.
				    The basic idea is that crypto works through a distributed ledger, or “blockchain,” that serves as an entirely public transaction database.
				    In layman’s terms, a blockchain is basically a buzzword for a record of transactions. Each new transaction is attached to the previous transactions all the way back to the very first block. What makes blockchain special is the fact that there are millions of copies of say the chain for bitcoin on millions of computers. The security of a transaction is based upon the idea that transactions can be verified by checking the ledgers of the copied chains across computers, and differences in a chain would cause a transaction not to go through. So each ledger on each computer is keeping one another accountable, all in a decentralized and anonymous fashion.
				    The “magic” of blockchain is just that. Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of blockchain, created a method to solve the issue of verifying a transaction without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
					</p>

					<h2>Who is Playing the Game?</h2>

					<p>Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the amount of exchanges, mining pools, and average investors catering to cryptocurrencies have grown immensely. Some of the largest exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and GDax have upwards of billions of US dollars in trade volume each day.</p><br>
					<p>Mining is also an essential aspect of cryptocurrencies. A miner for a blockchain finds “blocks,” which are just batches of valid transactions for a currency, and hashes and encodes them into a Merkle tree. Each new block contains the encrypted hash of the previously created block, thus linking the transactions and creating a chain which goes back to the genesis block.
				    However, the days of easily encoding a minute amount of transactions are long gone, and an individual miner with basic computer hardware would require centuries to successfully encrypt a new block. Thus there was a birth of mining pools which share the computing power of any user who wishes to join, and distributes the reward for continuing the chain amongst members equally based off of their contribution amount.
					</p><br>
					<p>So what about the average investor who is supporting crypto by purchasing and adopting the use of the currency.
				    In the past, the process of getting started with crypto was difficult. Investors would have needed to have a secure wallet on their computer, or have it stored on the early possibly not very secure exchanges around 2012. It was a niche market and that showed in the valuation of each coin, with Bitcoin being worth about 12 USD in 2012.
				    However, with the advent of Coinbase in late 2012, the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies through smartphones started to get the ball rolling for average investors who didn’t want to worry about the technical aspects of the market. Since 2012, Coinbase has grown to harbor over 15 million active users, and the value of currencies themselves have also grown exponentially along with the increase of users throughout the last decade.

								<h1>Coin Market</h1>
								<p>There have been distinct eras withing the decade long history of
									 cryptocurrency. The early hobby era from the launch of Bitcoin in 2009
								 to the foundation of the two trading platforms: Mt. Gox and the Silk Road marketplace.
							   The period of growth crashed horribly when both exchanges collapsed and Bitcoin dropped from $1000 to
							 	just under $300.<br /><br />
								Then, in 2014-2016, there was a diversification of crypto from only Bitcoin to Ethereum and other platforms
							  using crypto as a vehicle for providing decentralized services. The days of blockchain.<br /><br />
								In 2017, crypto then shot to the moon with consumers all hopping on the Bitcoin train in the hopes of getting rich
								quick. Bitcoin topped $20000, and crypto suddenly became a 750 Billion dollar market.<br /><br />
								But as quick as it rose, crypto died down, the market corrected and Bitcoin dropped to $8000 per coin. Commisions
								like the SEC started to become more involved and crypto has started to become more like a convential stock exchange.</p>

									just needs to time to work out the kinks before crypto starts backing more mainstream economies.</p>

					<h1>Topic: Issues with Crypto</h1>
					<h3>Energy</h3>
					<p>There’s talk that cryptocurrencies will eliminate dependency on bank accounts and money-transferring services. But, all that talk isn’t talking about the huge amount of energy mining takes to maintain a blockchain.
					If we take crypto seriously, we need to have a more sustainable way to mining blocks and reduce energy consumption.
					In fact, studies have show that the energy required to maintain JUST Bitcoin’s blockchain is about the same amount of energy that Ireland consumes. That’s a country’s worth of energy.
					One of the largest energy sinks associated with crypto mining is the energy required to cool the computer components. Most commercial miners utilize large data center like warehouses which cool the entire space like an oversized refrigerator.
					The other most obvious use of energy is related to the power consumed by computations. Most of that energy is produced through burning fossil fuels, so a large part of making crypto more sustainable is to reduce the ecological impact it has in its energy consumption.

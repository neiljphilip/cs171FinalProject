					<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>

					<p> Cryptocurrency (or crypto) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transaction of assets. Cryptocurrencies are an alternative digital currency. Crypto also uses decentralized control to handle all transactions instead of the modern day system of handling digital currency by verifying them through central banking systems like Visa and MasterCard.</p>

					<h2>The "Magic" of Blockchain</h2>

					<p>But how does it work? Crypto has been thrown around a lot in the past couple of years but many people still have little to no idea of how the currency actually works.
				    The basic idea is that crypto works through a distributed ledger, or “blockchain,” that serves as an entirely public transaction database.
				    In layman’s terms, a blockchain is basically a buzzword for a record of transactions. Each new transaction is attached to the previous transactions all the way back to the very first block. What makes blockchain special is the fact that there are millions of copies of say the chain for bitcoin on millions of computers. The security of a transaction is based upon the idea that transactions can be verified by checking the ledgers of the copied chains across computers, and differences in a chain would cause a transaction not to go through. So each ledger on each computer is keeping one another accountable, all in a decentralized and anonymous fashion.
				    The “magic” of blockchain is just that. Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of blockchain, created a method to solve the issue of verifying a transaction without the need of a trusted authority or central server.
					</p>

					<h2>Who is Playing the Game?</h2>

					<p>Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the amount of exchanges, mining pools, and average investors catering to cryptocurrencies have grown immensely. Some of the largest exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Bittrex, and GDax have upwards of billions of US dollars in trade volume each day.</p><br>
					<p>Mining is also an essential aspect of cryptocurrencies. A miner for a blockchain finds “blocks,” which are just batches of valid transactions for a currency, and hashes and encodes them into a Merkle tree. Each new block contains the encrypted hash of the previously created block, thus linking the transactions and creating a chain which goes back to the genesis block.
				    However, the days of easily encoding a minute amount of transactions are long gone, and an individual miner with basic computer hardware would require centuries to successfully encrypt a new block. Thus there was a birth of mining pools which share the computing power of any user who wishes to join, and distributes the reward for continuing the chain amongst members equally based off of their contribution amount.
					</p><br>
					<p>So what about the average investor who is supporting crypto by purchasing and adopting the use of the currency.
				    In the past, the process of getting started with crypto was difficult. Investors would have needed to have a secure wallet on their computer, or have it stored on the early possibly not very secure exchanges around 2012. It was a niche market and that showed in the valuation of each coin, with Bitcoin being worth about 12 USD in 2012.
				    However, with the advent of Coinbase in late 2012, the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies through smartphones started to get the ball rolling for average investors who didn’t want to worry about the technical aspects of the market. Since 2012, Coinbase has grown to harbor over 15 million active users, and the value of currencies themselves have also grown exponentially along with the increase of users throughout the last decade.

					<h1>Coin Market</h1>
					<p>There have been distinct eras withing the decade long history of
						 cryptocurrency. The early hobby era from the launch of Bitcoin in 2009
					 to the foundation of the two trading platforms: Mt. Gox and the Silk Road marketplace.
				   The period of growth crashed horribly when both exchanges collapsed and Bitcoin dropped from $1000 to
						just under $300.</p>
					<p>Then, in 2014-2016, there was a diversification of crypto from only Bitcoin to Ethereum and other platforms
						using crypto as a vehicle for providing decentralized services. The days of blockchain.</p>
					<p>In 2017, crypto then shot to the moon with consumers all hopping on the Bitcoin train in the hopes of getting rich
						quick. Bitcoin topped $20000, and crypto suddenly became a 750 Billion dollar market.</p>
					<p>But as quick as it rose, crypto died down, the market corrected and Bitcoin dropped to $8000 per coin. Commisions
					like the SEC started to become more involved and crypto has started to become more like a convential stock exchange.</p>

					<p>So even with the stomach turning events following crypto, the amount of attention crypto
						is beneficial in introducing the benefits of a decentralized and secure currency. The market
						just needs to time to work out the kinks before crypto starts backing more mainstream economies.</p>

						<h1>Central Governments in a Decentralized World</h1>
						<p>As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the world's nations are divided on how to regulate the resource
							 as most digital currencies are not backed by any government. Most countries bend to a one side or the other regarding
						 	 the legality of crypto. Globally, each country decides whether coins like Bitcoin are legal tender, but have no regulations
						 	 regarding cryptocurrency exchanges. Here's how the world is divided up.</p>

					</div>
					<div>
						<p>There's a huge variation regarding crypto. Although China has outright banned crypto usage and trading, many countries like India, Korea, the US and also the EU have stated that
							 crypto is not legal tender, but have legal policies regarding crypto exchanges. On the other hand, countries like Switzerland and Japan
						 	 are welcoming the new age of currency with open arms by accepting the use of and exchange of cryptocurrencies.<br /><br />
						 	 The countries who are against usage of crypto as legal tender have cited reasons being the difficulty in tracking the usage of crypto in regards to criminal activity
						 	 and the difficulty of being able to tax citizens' gains on crypto, while countries like Switzerland have openly stated that crypto is "more of an investment than a currency."<br /><bR />
						 	 So althgouth the world is divided on how to tackle cryptocurrency, it's clear that there are both benefits and drawbacks to embracing this new resource.</p>

					<h1>What's Stopping Cryptocurrency?</h1>
					<h3>Energy</h3>
					<p>There’s talk that cryptocurrencies will eliminate dependency on bank accounts and money-transferring services. But, all that talk isn’t talking about the huge amount of energy mining takes to maintain a blockchain.
					If we take crypto seriously, we need to have a more sustainable way to mining blocks and reduce energy consumption.
					In fact, studies have show that the energy required to maintain JUST Bitcoin’s blockchain is about the same amount of energy that Ireland consumes. That’s a country’s worth of energy.
					One of the largest energy sinks associated with crypto mining is the energy required to cool the computer components. Most commercial miners utilize large data center like warehouses which cool the entire space like an oversized refrigerator.
					The other most obvious use of energy is related to the power consumed by computations. Most of that energy is produced through burning fossil fuels, so a large part of making crypto more sustainable is to reduce the ecological impact it has in its energy consumption.
					</p>
					<h3>Market Manipulation</h3>
					<p>
						In a world rife with a multitude of exchanges like Bitfinex, GDax, Coinbase, and Kucoin, all of which are highly unregulated.
						there is rampent manipulation of coin prices in effort to make rich patrons of crypto richer. The so called, "crypto whales,"
						have such deep crypto pockets in a relativly low trader populated market, that individuals can single handedly manipulate an exchange.
						<br /> They do so through two basic methods: price suppresion, and price pumping.<br /><Br />
						In price suppresion, whales submit huge orders at incredibly low prices to force the price of a coin to drop dramatically,
						then once their sell wall has satisfactorily been covered, the whale is free to purchase back more coins than they sold at a lower
						price point. This is done during a period right before a beneficial announcment to a coin in effort to capitalize on potential gains.<br /><br />
						Price pumping is simply the opposite, whale place buy orders at inflated prices with a portion of their coins before selling all at once once their
						optimal price has been reached. <br /><br />
						This manipulation of coin prices is ongoing in many exchanges as there aren't enough traders to combat this issue with whale leverage.
						And in effect, it creates market panic and causes many average investors to lose incredible amounts of money to these schemes.
					</p>
					<h3>Criminal Activity</h3>
					<p>
						Many people today associate cryptocurrency with crime. But is this fact or ignorance? The media has made
						a big deal of people using crypto to evade taxes, but although there is plenty of evidence pointing to the benefits of crypto
						why is there such a bias into thinking crime is elevated with crypto?<br /><br />
						One large reason could be Bitcoin's association with The Slik Road, an online site catering to individuals seeking drugs, weapons and other illicit
						goods. Their main source of payment was bitcoin, due to it's decentralization and anonymity. However, in 2011, the site was shut down by the Federal government.
						but the reputation lives on.<br /><br />
						Since then many criminal activities associated with ransom have defaulted to Bitcoin as their method of payment due to again, the anonymity. Another issue is hackers
						tapping into the power of people's computers, using free electricity to generate millions in crypto. Ironically, the US government has also argued against the use of
						crypto due to their untracable nature, even though dollar bills are generally used by criminals to launder their dirty cash as a digital footprint could almost always
						be tracked.<br /><br />
						A big proponent to crypto and crime is scams. From fake ICO's to hacks on exchange, the wild west of this new currency brings in many investors
						unfamilar with how the currency works and so they get lured into giving up their coins and falling for schemes and scams, thus creating a cycle of
						association with crypto and danger.
					</p>
					<div id="crimeChart">

					</div>
					<h3>Transaction Delay</h3>
					<p>
						Another glaring issue with adopting cryptocurrency globally is the fact that transactions just aren't as fast as Visa or Mastercard.
						When coins like Bitcoin and USDT take up to an hour to successfully process, it's difficult to support the currency in a fast paced economy we have today.
						And although coins like XRP and XLM do boast near instant transactions, this is untested at the volumes Bitcoin processes, and is far below the volume of transactions
						going through either Visa or Mastercard, so before we think about adopting crypto to pay for our next meals, their need to be a solution to increasing the verification speeds.

					<h1>What's in Store for Cryptocurrencies?</h1>
					<p>
						But this isn't the end all be all of crypto, there are efforts in all of these issues tryihng to make crypto a viable option for global trade.
						For example, the issue of huge cooling centers is trying to be tackled by 3M, who are developing less wasteful methods of cooling using immersion
						techniques, rather than the tradition radial cooling of components. This new emphasis on crypto is also placing more efforts to reduce reliance
						on fossil fuels in general. Soluna Technologies is one of the innovators in the sector, trying to be the first blockchain company to integrate solely
						on renewable wind power. And efforts like these are being developed constantly, there just needs to be more time.
					</p>
					<p>
						What about transaction speed? As a global economy we can't wait for transactions to happen when money is literally on the line.
						Currently Visa is leading the globe with a theorethical 24000 transactions filled per second (TPS). Paypal can support 200TPS but Bitcoin can only handle maybe
						1-2TPS, leaving customers waiting hours being a sale being finalized, leaving room for both the customer and the retailer
						worried about their payment solution. However, bitcoin's goal was to prove the concept of the blockchain, they weren't optimized
						for such laborious tasks such as processing thousands of tranaction requests. But coins like Ripple were built with speed in mind.
						The creators of the coin claims that the chain can handle 1500TPS comfortably due to the commpany's roots in banking software and
						improving Bitcoin's original algorithm. For developing a coin with faster transaction speeds than even Paypal, the future looks promising for mainstream use of
						crypto.
					</p>
					<p>But even with these strides, crypto is going to need a lot more tweeks and improvements before being accepted by the masses.
						 Regulations and crime still need to be worked out, speeds need to be improved, and the talks about sustainablity are real issues for the future.
						 But because so much work has been going into bringing crypto to the masses, the future looks promising, and maybe we'll be purchasing goods from anywhere in the World
						 with a single currency.
